# Introduction to `git`

This will be an in-lab exercise where we'll experience several of the
key features of the `git` version control system, and the Github
repository hosting service.

:bangbang: While in most labs it will be fine for groups to move ahead
at their own pace, in this lab we'd like people to keep together
because there are moments where we're expecting certain things to
happen (e.g., merge conflicts) and we want everyone to be in roughly
the same place when that happens.

This definitely will _not_ provide a comprehansive overview of the
_many_ features `git` provides. There are a lot of on-line resources
that can provide additional information, including:

* The excellent [Atlassian `git` tutorials](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/what-is-version-control)
* A very nice [on-line tutorial from Code School](https://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1)
* [The "standard" `git` documentation site](https://git-scm.com/documentation),
which also includes links to videos, cheat sheets, and such
* [`git` â€“ the simple guide](http://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/),
a single-page app that goes through the major features of `git`
* [The original blog post on the Gitflow branching model](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/)
(and [a later post arguing that GitFlow is a Very Bad Idea](http://endoflineblog.com/gitflow-considered-harmful))
* [Git Essential Training](https://www.lynda.com/Git-tutorials/Git-Essential-Training/100222-2.html),
an on-line Lynda.com course; it's free if you first authenticate
with your U of M credentials via http://lynda.umn.edu
